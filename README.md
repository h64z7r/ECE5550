ECE5550, STATE-SPACE DYNAMIC SYSTEMS
Example: The nearly constant velocity (NCV) model
■ Another model we might consider is that of an object with momentum.
■ The velocity is nearly constant, but gets perturbed by external forces.
■ We let our model state be

■ Our model’s state equation is then

■ One possible output equation is

■ A possible Simulink implementation and output trajectory:

■ A third model considers an object moving in a 2D plane with constant speed and angular rate Ωwhere Ω > 0 is counter-clockwise motion and Ω < 0 is clockwise motion.

■ We again let our model state be

■ Our model’s state equation is then

■ One possible output equation is
